This is a pet project that I decided to share with my friends. I have subtitled all of the non-speaking roles, R2-D2, Sandpeople, Jawas, Chewbacca, other misc droids.

At this time I have only subtitled Star Wars IV: A New Hope

****CONTENT WARNING****

It should be noted that this subtitle file will, for all intents and purposes, turn the current PG rated version of the movie into a solid R for language and mature themes.
Use them at your own risk.
